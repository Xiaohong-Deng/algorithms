# Algorithms

Algorithmic implementations for self-contained and distinct mini-problems. From basic algorithms and data structures like sorting or linked list to domain specific ones like Hybrid A*.

## Domain Specific Problem Sets
### Discrete Optimization
`discrete-opt`

NP-hard or NP-complete problems that non-exponential solutions is not possible for general cases. What we can do includes find feasible solutions for special or common cases or try approximation as opposed to accurate solutions.

More than one approaches for each of the problems.

Currently has the following problems

1. 0-1 knapsack
2. graph coloring

Documentations are available under the subdirectory.

### ML and AI Algorithms
`ML-AI-algo`

Prototypes or simplified algorithmic applications that serve as demonstration.

Documentations are available under the subdirectory.
