# Algorithms

Algorithmic implementations for self-contained and distinct mini-problems. From basic algorithms and data structures like sorting or linked list to domain specific ones like Hybrid A*.

## Discrete Optimization
NP-hard or NP-complete problems that non-exponential solutions can only be found for specific cases or all cases but optimality of the solutions can not be guarenteed.

More than one approaches for each of the problems.

Currently has the following problems

1. 0-1 knapsack
2. graph coloring

Documentations are available under the subdirectory.

## ML-AI-algo
Prototypes or simplified applications that serve as demonstration.

Documentations are available under the subdirectory.
